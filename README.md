# learning-to-code
Templates for teaching myself to code.

If you're reading this, it means I have made my repository public. This repo solely exists to teach myself how to code and is not meant for anyone else.
That being said, I have no issue if people want to use or fork this to teach themselves to code.
Each program has a list of common functions that are added on to help me remember what they do.
